This is for implementing Dagger Library. 
Primiarily for the purpose of how to use dependency injection
using Dagger Library in various ways to interact with it:
1. DI with non parameterized classes
2. DI working with properity libraries kind of like simulation with a custom class
3. DI working with interfaces
4. DI with parameterized Constructors
Implementing Singleton Annotation for Componenet class to opitmize performance by
limiting it's instationations to one.
